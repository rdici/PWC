Input: $s = "Perl"
Output: 1

Input: $s = "TPF"
Output: 3

Input: $s = "PyThon"
Output: 0

Input: $s = "raku"
Output: 2
=#

using Printf
words = ["Perl", "TPF", "PyThon", "raku"]

for s in words  
  @printf("Input: \$s = \"%s\"\n",s)
  if occursin(r"^[A-Z][a-z]*$", s ) 
    @printf("Output: 1\n")
  elseif occursin(r"^[a-z]*$", s)
    @printf("Output: 2\n")
  elseif occursin(r"^[A-Z]*$", s)
    @printf("Output: 3\n")
  else
    @printf("Output: 0\n")
  end
  println(" ")
