Challenge 191 Cute List ( Perl )

You are given an integer, 0 < $n <= 15.

Write a script to find the number of orderings of numbers that form a cute list.

With an input @list = (1, 2, 3, .. $n) for positive integer $n, an ordering of @list is cute if for every entry, indexed with a base of 1, either

1) $list[$i] is evenly divisible by $i
or
2) $i is evenly divisible by $list[$i]

Example

Input: $n = 2
Ouput: 2

Since $n = 2, the list can be made up of two integers only i.e. 1 and 2.
Therefore we can have two list i.e. (1,2) and (2,1).

@list = (1,2) is cute since $list[1] = 1 is divisible by 1 and $list[2] = 2 is divisible by 2.

def main(n)
  arr = (1..n.to_i).to_a
  len = arr.length()
  puts "Input:  #{len}"
  arr.permutation(len).to_a.each do |suba|
    res = 0
    res2 = 0
    success = 0
    (0..len-1).each do |x|
      res = suba[x] % (x+1);
      res2 = (x+1) % suba[x];
      if ((res == 0) || (res2 == 0) ) 
        success += 1;
      end
      if (success == len) 
        puts("\[#{suba}\] is cute!");
      end
    end
  end
  puts " "
end

for arg in ARGV
   #puts arg
   if (( arg.to_i < 1) || (arg.to_i > 15)) 
    puts "Error: supplied arg = #{arg}. arg must be greater than 0 and less than 16";
    exit;
   end
   main(arg)
end
